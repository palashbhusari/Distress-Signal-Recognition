To detect a human wave using pose estimation from a camera feed, you can follow these general steps:

1. Load the Pose Estimation Model: There are several deep learning-based models available for human pose estimation, such as OpenPose and PoseNet. You can download and load one of these models to your Python environment using a suitable library, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

2. Capture Camera Feed: Capture the camera feed using OpenCV or any other suitable library.

3. Extract Key Points: Use the pose estimation model to extract the key points of the human body from each frame of the camera feed.

4. Identify Arm Movement: Analyze the key points to identify the movement of the arms. For example, a wave typically involves swinging the arms back and forth.

5. Classify as Wave: If the movement of the arms matches the characteristics of a wave, classify the gesture as a wave and take the desired action (e.g., display a message on the screen).
